This repository is designed to allow makers without access to an oscilloscope but with access to a microcontroller (Arduino, ESP, etc.) to monitor signals in a similar manner. This repository holds the central codebase needed to implement the [Microcontroller Oscilloscope](https://github.com/Microcontroller-Oscilloscope) on a microcontroller. Navigate to [Core](https://github.com/Microcontroller-Oscilloscope/Core) to get started.
